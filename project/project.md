## Abstract

As the world begins to utilize online service and stores at greater capacity it becomes a greater priority to increase the efficiency of the various processes that are required for online stores to work effectively. By analyzing the data the comes from online purchases, a better understanding can be formed about what is needed and where as well as the quantity. This data should also allow for us to better predict what orders will be needed at future times so shortages can be avoided.

It seems that people in specific zip codes order more from amazon then others.

## Getting a Good Grade

### General Trends

What needs to be done to get a good grade: Finding general trends for Brazilian Amazon E-Commerce. Determining which area of people orders the most amount of goods from amazon. Determining which goods are most frequently bought and other summary information. Determining what kind of payments are being made and how they are being made.

For this project I need to work with a dataset of 100,000 that has various amazon orders ranging from basic items to more expensive and complex things. The only limiter is what was being sold on amazon at that point in time. The data set size is only 120.3 MB and I will be using markdown to show my findings and how I got to them.

### Regional View

I will need to correctly articulate the scope of what the dataset is measuring and the region that it is as well as when the data was collected for the project. I will also need to come up with a viable solution for any (if there is) missing data that exists in the data set. I should also look into the ways that the different data sheets interact with one another to find any patterns or factors that could exist that aren&#39;t otherwise easily seen.


### Surprising or Unexpected Findings

The best way for me to get a good grade would be to find something unusual or unexpected from the amazon orders. Either regions that order more of a particular thing or have more expensive purchase or have more of a frequency of purchases. Some thing that would be nice is to have good visualization in respect to a map of brazil to help give a better understand of where the areas are in realization to one another as well as any hotspots that may occur within the data that are in close proximity to one another.

Getting a good great should also require me finding any correlations between the multiple sets of data. As well as grouping different variables in relation to how much money is spent on products in amazon. It would also be good for me to find ways to group customers into different categories based on a combination of their location and how much money they spend on average.

Getting data on reoccurring customers is a must if I&#39;m able to do so. Being able to get information on people would keep buying more and more products from amazon.com would be an important application of big data due to the fact that it can help support better ways for frequent users to buy and also more things that they would be interested in spending there. If it was possible to have more datasets for different countries, I would be able to catch trends for purchase in different places and areas. Finding the datasets would be a problem as well as the sear amount of amazon purchase data would take too long to process therefore it is probably just better to stick to the scope of data that I have and see if there are trends that can be observed in the different regions of brazil.

For the conclusion I should be able to point out any trends that could help potential grow in brazil by introducing more products or determining which products aren&#39;t as important or which prices should be increased for the sake of profit.


## Introduction

Brazil has the largest E-commerce market in Latin America. "It has been estimated that the country accounts for over one third of the region's ecommerce market"[^2]. However, the growth of the potential e-commerce giant has problems that could potential stunt its long term growth. In this analysis I will try to better illustrate a better picture to determine more partical ways to increase e-commerce growth in Brazil and possibile by extention this method can be superimposed on other regions of the world.
